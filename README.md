🚀 DevOps Task 1 – Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Node.js, Docker & GitHub Actions
This project is built as part of a DevOps Internship Task to showcase hands-on skills in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using modern tools and workflows. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a simple Node.js application by leveraging Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for workflow automation.

🔧 Highlights of the Project:

📦 Developed a lightweight Node.js server using Express.

🐳 Dockerized the application to ensure portability and consistency across environments.

🔁 Configured a GitHub Actions pipeline to automate:

Source code checkout

Dependency installation

Docker image build

Image push to DockerHub

🔐 Integrated GitHub Secrets for secure DockerHub authentication.

This project demonstrates the ability to implement infrastructure as code, maintain repeatable deployments, and follow DevOps best practices — all essential for real-world production environments.
